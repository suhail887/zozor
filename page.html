                    <p>Stop acting like you know. Taxi drivers and bartenders are your consiglieres, your guides. Don’t tell them where you want to go; 
                        ask them to point you where you should be. This also applies at restaurants. I gave up menus and entries years ago. Make snacks 
                        your friends and simply ask the experts (i.e. people
                         who work there) what you should be eating. If you already know what you want, then you really didn’t need to leave home in the 
                         first place.</p>
                    <p>Vivamus sed libero nec mauris pulvinar facilisis ut non sem...Ask people what you should go see.
                         I found all the highlights of this road trip by following suggestions from locals (some of them strangers, but now friends)
                         .Avoid highways:
                         stick to the small roads to soak up real flavour while you travel..When someone invites you over to their house,
                          or out to dinner, or on a tour — take them up on it (but be safe). Heartfelt generosity is the reason 
                          I’ve been able to travel so long on so little money.
                          People love The Golden Rule of Guesting: bring your host a gift (books work well).</p>
                    <p>Phasellus ligula massa, congue ac vulputate non, dignissim at augue...Everyone at the hotel gets a tip 
                        except for the people who make sure your sheets are clean and your bed is made? Common. Leave a few bucks
                         with a note attached to thank the maids,
                         the most under-appreciated (and most important) people there. I never thought I’d say that,
                          but one thing the Brits do well is self-deprecation. Be fully prepared to make fun of yourself, or your home town. 
                          There’s nothing worse than a traveller who’s deadest on convincing everyone that they’re not a stereotype.leave 
                          a room/house in better shape than when you got there and never ever show up at a host’s place empty handed.
                           I usually take 4-5 copies of my favorite book for these occasions (if you follow my 10 rules of packing, you should have plenty of room);
                           ink on paper lasts a lot longer than the predictable bottle of wine will..When someone invites you over to their house,
                            or out to dinner, or on a tour — take them up on it (but be safe). Heartfelt generosity is the reason I’ve been able to travel
